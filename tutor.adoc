== Step-by-step tutorial

=== Prerequisites

In this tutorial, it is assumed that user has a Developers' API subscription
and has generated API credentials (API Key Id and API Secret Key).

=== Identifying image metadata

At first, following information about an image must be gathered: its file name,
MIME type, byte size, and MD5 checksum.  It is required to upload an image
to the cloud.

==== A file name

The picture has been saved as `fishpic.jpg`, thus its file name is
`fishpic.jpg`, obviously.  (Note: this must be a base name, that is without
a directory path)

==== A MIME type

A list of common MIME types can be found on Mozilla's MDN pages:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types.
The picture is a JPEG image, hence its MIME type is `image/jpeg`.

There are several tools to identify image's MIME type automatically.  Perhaps
the most convenient one is a `file` program that is available on many UNIX-like
systems:

[lang,sh]
----
$ file --mime-type -b fishpic.jpg
image/jpeg
----

==== A byte size

A byte size is a number of bytes that given file is composed of.

One way to get this number is `wc -c` command:

[lang,sh]
----
$ wc -c fishpic.jpg
2204455 fishpic.jpg
----

==== A checksum

Finally, an MD5 checksum needs to be calculated for an image.  A checksum is
required to be Base64-encoded for transport purposes.

There are many ways to get a checksum, for example by using OpenSSL toolkit:

[lang,sh]
----
$ openssl dgst -md5 -binary < fishpic.jpg | openssl enc -base64
EA5w4bPQDfzBgEbes8ZmuQ==
----

=== Authorizing requests

==== Finding credentials

In this tutorial, following API credentials will be used.

|===
| API Key ID     | c0fae174f24c0950352c2bbd
| API Secret Key | 5edac99f92bf7acb66425c47fb153c5f
|===

To prevent from abuse, the API key shown in this tutorial has been already
deleted.  Don't use it as it won't work, please use your own instead.

WARNING: Never reveal API Secret Key nor pass it to untrusted machines.

==== Obtaining an access token

Now it's time to get an access token.  This is done by sending API credentials
to `https://api-users.fishial.ai/v1/auth/token`, as illustrated in a cURL
snipped below:

----
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-users.fishial.ai/v1/auth/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "client_id": "c0fae174f24c0950352c2bbd",
    "client_secret": "5edac99f92bf7acb66425c47fb153c5f"
  }'
----

The response includes a bearer token that should be used in `Authorization` HTTP
header in subsequent API calls.

[lang,json]
----
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTY2MTkzNzQsImtpZCI6ImMwZmFlMTc0ZjI0YzA5NTAzNTJjMmJiZCJ9.SwJITJXPcGXu9E6UYPNXq0kTfPRZ_O-qe3FGV7ZTxZM"
}
----

NOTE: The Access Token is valid for 10 minutes and can be passed to client
machines without compromising API Secret Key.

=== Uploading an image to the cloud

==== Obtaining a URL for image upload

Before we actually upload a picture, we need to get a signed URL that allows us
to do so.  The request body includes image metadata that were obtained earlier.
The signed URL won't allow a file that doesn't match that metadata.

----
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.fishial.ai/v1/recognition/upload \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTY2MTkzNzQsImtpZCI6ImMwZmFlMTc0ZjI0YzA5NTAzNTJjMmJiZCJ9.SwJITJXPcGXu9E6UYPNXq0kTfPRZ_O-qe3FGV7ZTxZM' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "blob": {
      "filename": "fishpic.jpg",
      "content_type": "image/jpeg",
      "byte_size": 2204455,
      "checksum": "EA5w4bPQDfzBgEbes8ZmuQ=="
    }
  }'
----

The response is quite lengthy and looks like this:

[lang,json]

    }
  }
}

However, only a few entries are important for us.

`signed-id`::
  Will be used at the last step.

`direct-upload.url`::
  A URL that picture should be submitted to.

`direct-upload.headers`::
  A set of headers that should be set when uploading an image.

==== Sending an image

Having a signed URL (i.e. `direct-upload.url` from the previous step), we may
actually send an image to that URL.  Please note that the request method is
`PUT`, not usual `POST`:

[lang,sh]
----
curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/backend-fishes-storage-prod/hpleg1o4wez3e7mvy1sivhep9dw6?GoogleAccessId=services-storage-client%40ecstatic-baton-230905.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1656619087&Signature=aMeN%2FVW4I6LDgLRUEW0jzJqeA89gRpjn0TBcGMEnal3RU1iGqe0uOraHainV5qUw6tRPEBRBJ6rMeu9x0AmX6OC3Q8cCCmBUMs4k1jCQOnnCNgkttpU7ov%2FeZ9WpPr47rTQSd5np7jCG3EWVEBhNeP25%2BTx5JlKQQ8UErP%2Bc46Lr%2Bj28wgLw%2BeeVjO4sVjEnLx3djoZD0Htei5XR0YQKVr%2FGDbS4iBOmjPsD5g4txKM6071zft%2BFK6U7I%2FfWjef2w4Nx%2BVvdATkNRpVEzbkAv1lBWMhfrOLy5koJfGepFk0BGQbTXNokhFCQYxzQuJBeC1xubKHzZSQLCVnTXt4EXA%3D%3D' \
  --header 'Content-Disposition: inline; filename=\"fishpic.jpg\"; filename*=UTF-8'\'''\''fishpic.jpg' \
  --header 'Content-Md5: EA5w4bPQDfzBgEbes8ZmuQ==' \
  --header 'Content-Type:' \
  --data-binary @fishpic.jpg
----

There is an empty response body on successful request, and an error message
otherwise.

You need to be very careful when setting headers for the request.  Actually,
you should **only set headers that were returned along with an upload URL**
(i.e. in `direct-upload.headers` in the previous step), here
`Content-Disposition` and `Content-Md5`.  Extra headers often lead to signature
rejection, though some (e.g. `Accept`) are safe to use.

Some tools tend to add some standard headers on their own.  For example,
cURL sets `Content-Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` by default,
and this must be overridden.  Note that setting this header to `image/jpeg`
wouldn't work either, despite this is a JPEG file indeed, because it wasn't
included in `direct-upload.headers`.

A `Content-Disposition` header value in the above example may look odd, but it's
only due to Bash escaping.  In fact, there are only two single quotes between
`UTF-8` and `fishpic.jpg`, as returned from the previous request.

=== Fish detection

Then actual fish recognition may be performed.  There is only one query
parameter `q` that is set to `signed-id` returned along with an upload URL.

----
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fishial.ai/v1/recognition/image?q=eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBNVJjRlE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ%3D%3D--269b0ee106c8739e2248645965ad0fc868b20c7c' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTY2MTkzNzQsImtpZCI6ImMwZmFlMTc0ZjI0YzA5NTAzNTJjMmJiZCJ9.SwJITJXPcGXu9E6UYPNXq0kTfPRZ_O-qe3FGV7ZTxZM'
----

The response is quite lengthy, and it was redacted for clarity:

[lang,json]
----
{
  "results": [
    {
      "shape": { <redacted> },
      "species": [
        {
          "name": "Esox lucius",
          "accuracy": 1.0,
          "fishangler-id": "2a8d971e-de97-4295-8701-b4ea1a8f4da1",
          "fishangler-data": <redacted>
        },
        {
          "name": "Esox masquinongy",
          "accuracy": 0,
          "fishangler-id": "b9db34f3-4edb-4d6e-8fc6-f6588ca20299",
          "fishangler-data": <redacted>
        },
        {
          "name": "Salvelinus fontinalis",
          "accuracy": 0,
          "fishangler-id": "95672e98-93fa-4c16-b119-e384e6527424",
          "fishangler-data": <redacted>
        },
        {
          "name": "Sander vitreus",
          "accuracy": 0,
          "fishangler-id": "b1d261d9-eca8-4fdd-ae09-ca5257babf1b",
          "fishangler-data": <redacted>
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

Its structure reads as follows:

- The `results` array contains fish shapes that were recognized on given image.
- The `results[n].shape` is a sequence of points that given fish shape consists
  of.
- The `results[n].species` is an array of species that were matched, with
  `accuracy` subfield indicating match probability (0 is the lowest, 1 is
  the highest).

In this case, `results` array contains only one item, and one of the matched
species has accuracy 1.0.  That means that according to Fishial AI, there's
only one fish on a picture, and it's a pike (_Esox lucius_), which is correct.

=== Sending a feedback

Finally, a user may wish to send a feedback agreeing with a recognition result:

----
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.fishial.ai/v1/ai-feedbacks/44062/entries \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTY2MTkzNzQsImtpZCI6ImMwZmFlMTc0ZjI0YzA5NTAzNTJjMmJiZCJ9.SwJITJXPcGXu9E6UYPNXq0kTfPRZ_O-qe3FGV7ZTxZM' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "data":{
      "type": "ai-feedback-entries",
      "attributes": {
        "polygon-id": "0",
        "feedback-type": "Agree"
      }
    }
  }'
----

Or disagreeing with it:

----
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.fishial.ai/v1/ai-feedbacks/44062/entries \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTY2MTkzNzQsImtpZCI6ImMwZmFlMTc0ZjI0YzA5NTAzNTJjMmJiZCJ9.SwJITJXPcGXu9E6UYPNXq0kTfPRZ_O-qe3FGV7ZTxZM' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "data":{
    "type": "ai-feedback-entries",
    "attributes": {
      "polygon-id": "0",
      "feedback-type": "Disagree",
      "suggested-name": "Sander vitreus"
    }
  }
}'
----

Where:

- `polygon-id` is an item index in the recognition's `results` array (starting
  with 0) that this user feedback refers to.  It also may be `null` when
  a feedback doesn't refer to any specific fish shape in the results list but
  to an image as whole, e.g. when there's some undetected fish on a picture or
  a picture doesn't actually show any fish.
- `feedback-type` is one of `Agree`, `Disagree`, or `Unknown`, and means if
  a user agreed with recognition result or not.
- `suggested-name` is a species name suggested by a user (makes sense only for
  a `Disagree` feedback type).
